# 🔐 Zero Trust Authentication System  
### *Never Trust. Always Verify.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Zero Trust Authentication System** is a security-first authentication platform built on modern **Zero Trust principles**, where no user, device, or request is trusted by default. Every access attempt is continuously verified using multi-layered security checks, real-time risk evaluation, and behavioral analysis.

This project demonstrates **practical cybersecurity engineering**, combining authentication, threat detection, and risk analytics into a single, scalable system.

## 🧠 Key Features

🔹 **Zero Trust Architecture**
- Implements *“Never Trust, Always Verify”* through continuous authentication and authorization checks.

🔹 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Secure OTP-based verification for login attempts.

🔹 **Session Binding & Time-Bound Access**
- Sessions are bound to device, IP, and time constraints to prevent session hijacking.

🔹 **Account Lockout & Brute-Force Protection**
- Automatically locks accounts after multiple failed login attempts.

🔹 **Risk Scoring Engine**
- Dynamically evaluates login behavior and assigns **Low / Medium / High** risk levels.

🔹 **Centralized Security Logging**
- Captures authentication events for monitoring, auditing, and incident response.

🔹 **Real-Time Risk Analytics Dashboard**
- Visualizes suspicious activity and risk trends using interactive graphs.

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

1️⃣ User submits login credentials  
2️⃣ System validates identity using password hashing  
3️⃣ OTP verification is triggered  
4️⃣ Device, IP, and session checks are applied  
5️⃣ Risk score is calculated in real time  
6️⃣ Access is granted or denied based on risk level
